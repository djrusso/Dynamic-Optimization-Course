# Dynamic programming and Optimal Control  

## Course Information
Schedule: Winter 2020, Mondays 2:30pm - 5:45pm

Location: Warren Hall, room #415 

Professor: Daniel Russo

TAs: Jalaj Bhandari and Chao Qin 

Course Number: B9120-001


## Course description:

This course serves as an advanced introduction to dynamic programming and optimal control. The first part of the course will cover  problem formulation and problem specific solution ideas arising in canonical control problems. The second part of the course covers algorithms, treating foundations of approximate dynamic programming and reinforcement learning alongside exact dynamic programming algorithms. 

## Tentative syllabus
* Problem formulations
  * Finite horizon
  * Infinite horizon discounted
  * Continuous-time discrete-state problems
  * Brief overview of average cost and indefinite horizon problems. 
* Problem specific ideas and examples
  * Myopic policies in optimal stopping 
  * Base-stock and (s,S) policies in inventory control
  * Linear policies in linear quadratic control
  * Kalman filtering and certainty equivalence in LQR with partial observability 
  * Interchange arguments and optimality of index policies in multi-armed bandits and control of queues. 
* Exact algorithms for problems with tractable state-spaces
  * Value Iterations
  * Policy Iteration
  * Linear Programming
* Foundations of reinforcement learning and approximate dynamic programming. 
  * Asynchronous value iteration 
  * Optimistic exploration 
  * Convergence of policy gradient methods 
  * Convergence of TD-learning 
  * Policy chattering in Q-learning 
  * Approximate linear programming


## Prerequisites
Markov chains; linear programming; mathematical maturity (this is a doctoral course). 

## Textbooks
Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control by Dimitris Bertsekas, 4th Edition, Volumes I and II. 


## Course requirements

You will be asked to scribe lecture notes of high quality. There will be a few homework questions each week, mostly drawn from the Bertsekas books. The main deliverable will be either a project writeup or a take home exam. 


## Homework 
We will have a short homework each week. Please write down a precise, rigorous, formulation of all word problems. For example, specify the state space, the cost functions at each state, etc. 

1. Due Monday 2/3: Vol I problems 1.23, 1.24 and 3.18
